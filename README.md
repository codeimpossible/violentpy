# Lessons from Violent Python
I'm going through the book [Violent Python](http://www.amazon.com/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers/dp/1597499579) "A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers, and Security Engineers". I want to be able to share the code that comes out of this and possibly use it later on.
